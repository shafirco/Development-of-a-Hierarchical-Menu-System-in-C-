In this project, I created a hierarchical menu system for console applications using C#. The system employs object-oriented programming principles, focusing on interfaces and delegates for managing menu interactions.

I implemented two versions: one using interfaces and the other using delegates. Each version handles user input, validates selections, and executes actions based on the menu choices. This project demonstrates a modular design, separating the menu logic from the user interface, making it reusable and maintainable.

The console application showcases both implementations, allowing navigation through different menu structures and performing associated actions.
